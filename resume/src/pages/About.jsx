      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7">
        I'm Iknoor — a front-end developer in progress, currently pursuing my
        BCA at Eternal University, Baru Sahib. I enjoy solving real-world
        problems through code and building projects that make everyday tasks
        simpler and more efficient.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mt-4">
        I have a strong interest in creating structured learning content,
        improving communication skills of students, and using creative teaching
        methods like picture prompts. Apart from coding, I have also worked as a
        <strong> Health & Hygiene Coordinator </strong> and volunteered to teach
        general knowledge and hygiene awareness to school students.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mt-4">
        My long-term dream is to become a skilled software engineer who builds
        meaningful applications while continuing to contribute to education and
        community growth.
